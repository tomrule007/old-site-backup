I'm getting back on the tech path that I left 7 years ago when I decided I wanted to learn to grow my own food and provide for myself right as I was finishing up a bachelors degree in electrical engineering. Well I did learn how to farm and started my own farming business just over a year after graduating. It was an exciting time but my goals were not exactly panning out as quickly as I would have liked and with the main goal of being landowners one day seemingly getting farther and farther away as the cost of living was rising much quicker than the publics demands for fresh flowers and vegetables was. My wife and I decided it was time to shut down the farm and get a fresh start on life moving from Santa Cruz, Ca. to the Portland Or. Metro area and pursue other careers. Hopefully one day soon we will own our own piece of land but for now we will just enjoy the less demanding farm free beautiful oregon summer months! :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","cover":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/about-me/about-me/","coverImageMaxWidth":800}}
